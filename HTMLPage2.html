    <h2> The history of artificial intelligence </h2>
    The history of the emergence of the term artificial intelligence dates back to the fifties of the twentieth century,
    specifically in the 1950
    when the scientist Alan Turing introduced what is known as the Turing test, which is meant to assess the intelligence of a computer, and
    classify it as intelligent if it is able to simulate the human mind.
    One year after the Turing Test appeared, the first program to use artificial intelligence was created by Christopher Strachey, who was head of programming research at Oxford University.
    Through a computer for the shopping process that a human person does in more than one store, this simulation aimed to measure the ability of the computer to learn, and this was the first
    successful experiment of what is known as machine learning.
    In 1979, the Stanford vehicle was built, the first computer-controlled vehicle, and the pace of acceleration in artificial intelligence began at the beginning
    of the twenty-first century until interactive robots became available in stores, but it went beyond that to a robot that interacts with different emotions through expressions Face, and other robots
    that have become carrying out difficult tasks such as the Nomad robot, which is tasked with searching and exploring for remote places
    in the Antarctic, and locating meteorites in the region.
