    <h2> The kinds of the artificial intelligence </h2>

    <h2> Limited or Narrow Artificial Intelligence: </h2>

    Limited or narrow artificial intelligence is one of the types of artificial intelligence that can perform specific and clear tasks, such as self-driving cars, or even speech
    or image recognition programs, or chess on smart devices, and this type of artificial intelligence is the most common and available in our time Present.

    <h2> Artificial General Intelligence: </h2>

    It is the type that can work with a capacity similar to the human ability in terms of thinking, as it focuses on making the machine capable of thinking and planning
    on its own and in a manner similar to human thinking, but there are no practical examples of this type, all that exists so far are just research studies It takes a lot
    of effort to develop it and turn it into reality, and the artificial neural network method is one of the ways to study general artificial intelligence, as it is concerned with producing
    a system of neural networks for the machine similar to those contained in the human body.

    <h2> Super Artificial Intelligence: </h2>

    Super artificial intelligence is considered the type that may exceed the level of human intelligence, and which can perform tasks better than what a specialized and knowledgeable
    person can do, and this type has many characteristics that it must include; Such as the ability to learn, plan, communicate automatically, and make judgments, but the concept of AI
    is considered a hypothetical concept that does not exist in our time.
